# LAB01 - Setting up Ansible & your Environment

During this lab you will configure ansible. You will be able to use ansible on the controller-node and run
your first commands on the ansible-nodes.

You have the IPs of the controller host and manageable nodes (given by your instructor). The controller host is where you execute Ansible from and the nodes represent the machines you like to manage. (We will do some configurations on the controller as well.)

To make it easier for inexperienced users we installed on the controller an editor and terminal accessible with your browser. You can then connect to the nodes from there.

Unless otherwise specified, your working directory for all labs should be `/home/ansible/techlab/`.

Some good advice:

- always read all the tasks first. Some tasks might not be clear until you get the whole scope of the lab
- open a terminal that you use only for ansible-doc (see later) and one terminal that you use for ad hoc commands (see later) to check the result of your plays.
- copypaste all the filenames etc from the labs to your playbooks. You will make less mistakes.

## Connect to your control host

### Webbrowser

Connect to your control host by pasting the dns-name into your webbroser

----
https://<dnsname>
----

Login using the following username and password:

----
username: ansible
password: << web password >>
----
After a successful login you should see an editor similar to _visual studio code_ in your browser. In the navigation bar you can open "Terminal" or press `ctrl-shift-^` to open a terminal. 
Do this now and then continue with the installation of Ansible.

### SSH

Use your favourite ssh-client to connect to the ip of your control host as user ansible. You can access the nodes using ssh as well.


### TASK 1
- Install all packages needed to use ansible on the controller.

[TIP]
====
Use `sudo` to elevate your privilege to that of `root`. Be sure to only use root priviledges for installing the packages, you should do the rest of the lab as user ansible.
====

- Test if you can connect to the nodes from your controller using SSH. Use their public IPs you received from
  your instructor
- Make sure python is installed on your nodes before continuing with the lab.

### TASK 2
- Create a SSH-keypair for the `ansible` user on the `controller`. Do not protect the keys with a password. 
- Enable SSH-key login for the `ansible` user on all nodes and the controller itself by distributing the SSH-public key.
- Test the login on the nodes and the controller using ansible.

### TASK 3
- Create an inventory file called `hosts` in your working directory with your public IPs:

[ini]
----  
[tower]
controller ansible_host=<your-controller-ip>

[web]
node1 ansible_host=<your-node1-ip>

[db]
node2 ansible_host=<your-node2-ip>
----

[TIP]
====
Instead of copying the ssh-id to the controller itself you could set "ansible_connection=local" in the inventory file for host "controller". Then ansible would not use ssh to connect to the controller, but use the "local" transport mechanism.
====

- Check if ansible is ready using the `ping` module to ping all hosts in your inventory  

### TASK 4
- Configure the `ansible` user to have root privilege on all hosts in your inventory file. Also enable login without a password for this user
- Test the functionality by running `sudo -v` as user `ansible` on all nodes

### TASK 5
- extend the inventory with a group `nodes` that has the groups `web` and `db` as members
- ping all servers in the group `nodes`

## Solutions
.Solution 1
[%collapsible]
====
Installing ansible with root privileges:
[shell]
----
# yum -y install ansible 
----

Opening a SSH connection:  
[shell]
----
$ ssh -l ansible <your-node1-ip>
----
- Enter "yes" when prompted if you want to continue connecting
- Copy paste your SSH-password you received from your instructor when prompted and hit return

On the nodes:  
[shell]
----
$ which python # (or which python3)
/usr/bin/python
----
====

.Solution 2
[%collapsible]
=====
[shell]
----
$ ssh-keygen #(no passphrase, just hit enter until the end)  
$ ssh-copy-id <node-ip>
----
Follow the prompt and enter the `ansible` user password you received from your instructor:

[NOTE]
====
Don't forget your controller and the second node.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh '5.102.146.128'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
----
Test it by running the ssh command executed on that node:
[shell]
----
$ ssh <node-ip> hostname
[yourusernamehere]-node1

$ ansible all -i hosts -m ping

.Solution 4
[%collapsible]
=====
In the file `/etc/sudoers` (On CentOS/RHEL), there's already a config entry for the wheel group that is similar to the one we need for our ansible user.

[shell]
----
$ ssh -l ansible <node-ip>
$ sudo -i
# grep wheel /etc/sudoers
## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

# echo 'ansible ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers
----
Check if `ansible` user has root privileges:
[shell]
----
sudo -v
----

[NOTE]
====
You cannot do this task using ansible yet. The reason being you need root privileges to change the sudoers configuration and we are just setting those privileges up right now.
