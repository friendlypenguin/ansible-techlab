# LAB04.3 - Ansible Playbooks - Templates

In this lab we start to use templates!

### TASK 1
- Rewrite your playbook `motd.yml` without using the `copy` module, but rather using the `template` module
- Use a jinja2 template file called `motd.j2` which uses the variable `motd_content`

### TASK 2
- Improve the template `motd.j2` by adding the default ip address of the server to the template. 
- Add the installed operating system to the motd file aswell

### TASK 3 (Advanced)
- Create a variable `users` like the following:
```
users:
  - name: jim
    food: pizza
  - name: sabrina
    food: burger
  - name: hans
    food: vegan
  - name: eveline
    food: burger
  - name: santos
```
- Put the variable in an appropiate place of your choosing
- Create a playbook `userplay.yml` doing the following on node1:
- Create a file /etc/dinner.txt with the content below by using the ansible module `template`:
```
<name_of_user> <food_for_user>
```
- There should be a entry in the file /etc/dinner.txt for each user in the variable `users` (use a for-loop in the template)
- If a user has no food specified, use `kebab` (have a look at "playbooks_filters" in the online docs)
- On node2 the same playbook `userplay.yml` should create a (linux) group for every different food specified in the variable `users`. If a user has no food defined, create the group `kebab` instead
- Create a user on node2 for every entry in the `users` variable. Ensure that this user is also in the group with the same name as his food. Again, if no food defined for this user, add group `kebab`
- BONUS: set the loginshell to /bin/zsh
- BONUS: if (and only if) the user is `santos`, disable login (means set the shell to `/usr/sbin/nologin` and use a if/else statement in the template to do so)
- BONUS: Set the default password on all servers to: <N0t_5o_s3cur3!> (the brackets <> are not part of the password.) Once the password was set, your playbook should not set it again or set it back to the default value once changed. Hash the password using the `sha512` algorithm. Don't define a salt for the password. Verify that you are able to login as one of the users via ssh and providing the password.

WARNING: Be aware that it is NOT a good idea to set passwords in cleartext. We will learn in the lab about ansible-vault how to handle this in a better way. Never ever do this in a productive environment.

### TASK 4 (Advanced)
- Create a playbook `serverinfo.yml` that does the following:
- Place a file `/root/serverinfo.txt` on all nodes with a line like follows for each server of the group `nodes` in the inventory:
```
server_hostname: OS: <operating system> IP: <IP address> Virtualization Role: <hardware type>
```
- Replace <operating system>, <IP address> and <hardware type> with a reasonable fact. 
- Run your playbook and check on all servers (by using an ansible ad hoc command) if the content of the file `/root/serverinfo.txt` is as expected.

## Solutions

.Solution 1
[%collapsible]
====
Create the file `motd.j2` with the following one liner:
[shell]
----
$ cat motd.j2
{{ motd_content }}
----
Edit your `motd.yml` playbook to use the file `motd.j2`:
[shell]
----
$ cat motd.yml 
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    motd_content: "This is my content"
  tasks:
    - name: set content of /etc/motd
      template:
        src: motd.j2
        dest: /etc/motd
----
Run the playbook again.
[shell]
----
$ ansible-playbook motd.yml -l node1,node2
----
====

.Solution 2
[%collapsible]
====
Add IP and OS to `motd.j2`:
[shell]
----
$ cat motd.j2
{{ motd_content }}
IP ADDRESS:	{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}
OS:		{{ ansible_os_family }}

----
Rerun the playbook and login to a node to check if the text has been changed accordingly:
[shell]
----
$ ansible-playbook motd.yml -l node1,node2
$ ssh -l ansible <node1-ip>
[3~Last login: Fri Nov  1 14:39:53 2019 from 5-102-146-174.cust.cloudscale.ch
This is node2

IP ADDRESS:     5.102.146.204
OS:             RedHat
[ansible@node2 ~]$

    - name: create groups
      group:
        name: "{{ item.food | default('kebab') }}"
      with_items: "{{ users }}"
    - name: ensure zsh is installed
      yum:
        name: zsh
        state: installed
    - name: create users
      user:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        group: "{{ item.food | default('kebab') }}"
        append: yes
        shell: "{% if item.name == 'santos' %}/usr/sbin/nologin{% else %}/usr/bin/zsh{% endif %}"
        password: "{{ 'N0t_5o_s3cur3!' | password_hash('sha512') }}"
        update_password: on_create
      with_items: "{{ users }}"

$ cat user_template.j2
{% for person in users %}
{{ person.name }}               {{ person.food | default('kebab') }}
{% endfor %}

TIP: See the user-module for how to set the password and search for a link to additional documentation about how to set passwords in ansible.

Check on node1 (as user root) if everthing is as expected:
[shell]
----
# cat /etc/dinner.txt 
jim         pizza
sabrina     burger
hans        vegan
eveline     burger
santos      kebab
----
Check as well on node2 (as user root):
[shell]
----
# grep  'jim\|sabrina\|hans\|eveline\|santos' /etc/passwd
jim:x:1002:1002::/home/jim:/usr/bin/zsh
sabrina:x:1003:1003::/home/sabrina:/usr/bin/zsh
hans:x:1004:1004::/home/hans:/usr/bin/zsh
eveline:x:1005:1003::/home/eveline:/usr/bin/zsh
santos:x:1006:1005::/home/santos:/usr/sbin/nologin

# grep  'pizza\|burger\|vegan\|kebab' /etc/group
pizza:x:1002:
burger:x:1003:
vegan:x:1004:
kebab:x:1005:
----
Login to node2 as user jim, providing the password via stdin:
[shell]

$ ssh jim@node2
